# CRUD-Generator
CRUD generator for MERN project

CRUD operation is root to every application. Defining Models, Routes and Controllers for features takes a lot of time and work. 
What if, we have a generator which could somehow do such repetitive work so we could focus more on other functional requirement in our system architecture.
Ofcourse it needs changes as it will not fully meet our need.

Its a simple step of handling our backend architecture by simply filling out a form from frontend UI.
